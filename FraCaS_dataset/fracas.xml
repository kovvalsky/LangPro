THE FRACAS TEXTUAL INFERENCE PROBLEM SET
=================================================================================

The textual inference problems contained in this file are derived from the
FraCaS project undertaken in the mid-1990s.  The source document is:

    "Using the Framework"
    The FraCaS Consortium
    Cooper et al.
    January 1996
    ftp://ftp.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/pub/FRACAS/del16.ps.gz

There are 346 problems.  Each problem contains one or more premises and one
question.  There are a total of 536 premises, or an average of 1.55 premises per
problem.  The premise counts are distributed as follows:

            # premises      # problems      % problems
            ----------      ----------      ----------
                1              192            55.5 %
                2              122            35.3 %
                3               29             8.4 %
                4                2             0.6 %
                5                1             0.3 %

Conversion to XML by Bill MacCartney (wcmac@cs.stanford.edu).  If you benefit
from my work, please give me appropriate credit.

Some notes on the XML representation:

The 'p' and 'q' elements:

    These contain the premises and the question from the original source
    problem.  Note that four problems are missing questions altogether.

    I have made some very minor corrections here and there, such as adding
    missing sentence-final periods.  But I've generally been reluctant to make
    other edits, even when the original is not perfectly grammatical.

The 'h' element:

    The original problems included questions, not hypotheses.  But in my work, I
    prefer to work with declarative hypotheses.  I've therefore introduced the
    'h' element, containing a sentence which is, as nearly as possible, the
    declarative equivalent to the question posed in the 'q' element.  The
    transformation from question form to declarative form was initially
    performed automatically, but all the results were manually reviewed and
    edited for correctness.  Note that in a few questions (specifically, those
    containing "any", "anyone", or "either"), it was necessary to change some
    key words to achieve grammaticality.  "Any" and "anyone" were replaced by
    "some" and "someone", while "either" was replaced by "one of the".  Problems
    38, 46, 54, 55, 62, 70, 71, 78, 107, 108, 141, 344 were affected in this
    way.

The 'a' element:

    Most problems in the source document included an answer, marked in square
    brackets.  The 'a' element shows that answer.  Most answers are "Yes",
    "Don't know", or "No", but some are longer phrases containing qualifications
    or elaborations such as "Yes, on one reading".  The answer distribution is
    roughly as follows:

        180    52%     Yes
         94    27%     Don't know
         31     9%     No
         41    12%     [other / complex]

The 'why' element:

    These elements contain text from the source document intended to explain or
    justify the answer.

The 'note' element:

    I've added notes to a number of problems in order to explain issues which
    arose during translation to XML.

The 'fracas_answer' attribute:

    To remedy the fact that the answers given in the source document are not
    restricted to a set of canonical values, most problems include a
    'fracas_answer' attribute, having one of the values {'yes', 'no', 'unknown',
    'undef'}.  In most cases, this attribute value was generated by the obvious
    mapping from the 'a' element, but for complex 'a' elements I used my own
    judgment in generating the 'answer' value.

The 'fracas_nonstandard' attribute:

    If the answer given in the source document is not one of {'Yes', 'No', or
    'Don't know'}, then the problem will include the 'fracas_nonstandard'
    attribute with value 'true'.  41 problems have this annotation.

    This answer seems dubious to me.  Apparently the FraCaS people interpret
    "many" as denoting a large proportion, whereas I interpret it as denoting a
    large absolute number.  That is, if "many" is regarded as a binary
    generalized quantifier, they want to say it's non-monotone in the first
    argument (and upward-monotone in the second), whereas I would say it's
    upward-monotone in both arguments.  Note that this problem is exactly the

<comment class="subsection"> 2.2 Definite Plurals </comment>

<comment>
  Definite plurals can often be non-anaphoric and behave like universally
  quantified noun phrases (90). However, as with (generic) bare plurals, the
  force of the quantification can also be less than universal (91). Whether this
  lessening of quantificational force is due to the noun phrase or to the
  predicate of which the NP is an argument is unclear (92, 93).

<comment class="section"> 4 ELLIPSIS </comment>

<comment>
  In nearly all cases the inferences presented here have conclusions that are
  simply reconstructions of the ellided constituent. Unfortunately, an inference
  test suite is not well suited to illustrating prohibitions on ellipsis
  resolution. For example, an ill-formed discourse like

  John was in Paris yesterday. *So did Bill.

  doesn't even get as far as supporting any inferences.

<comment> Note that the first sentence in (175) and (176) is syntactically
ambiguous, depending on whether the conjunctive clause conjoins with the main
or subordinate clause of "John said Mary wrote a report". In (177) the
conjunctive clause unambiguously conjoins with the subordinate clause, and
only one interpretation of the ellipsis is possible. This appears to indicate
that the antecedent clause to a VP ellipsis must be adjacent to the elliptical
clause. However, as the examples below show, this is not correct. </comment>

<comment>
  The inferences below carve up adjectives into (a by no means exhaustive)
  cross-cutting set of dimensions. Typical inferences are given for example
  adjectives.
</comment>

<comment class="subsection"> 5.1 Affirmative and Non-Affirmative </comment>

<comment>
  Affirmative adjectives map the denotation of the predicate they modify onto a
  subset of the denotation. So for example, an old man is a man. Most adjectives
  are affirmative, but a few like former and fake are not. Given that someone is
  a former student, one cannot conclude that they are now a student. But it is
  not entirely clear whether one can conclude that they are not now a student
  ... they may have become one again.

<comment class="subsection"> 5.2 No Comparison Class </comment>

<comment>
  Gradable adjectives (e.g. big, small) usually assume some form of comparison
  class (i.e. "big for an N"). But some others do not e.g. four-legged, or the
  adjectival phrase ten foot long. Adjectives not requiring a comparison class
  permit straightforward predication without reference to a nominal property
  providing a comparison class: a ten foot long alligator is ten foot long.

  Inferences (233)-(235) are similar to (230)-(232). Note however, that if
  "APCOM" can be interpreted as referring to a particular order (e.g. "the APCOM

  is ambiguous between a reading like that in (230)-(232), and one where ITEL

<comment class="section"> 7 TEMPORAL REFERENCE </comment>

<comment>
  Inference patterns involving temporal reference are complicated by the
  interplay between tense, aspectual information, lexical semantics, defeasible
  interpretation principles such as narrative progression, rhetorical relations,
  a theory of action and causation, world knowledge, interaction between
  plurality, genericity and temporal/aspectual phenomena etc. Some of the
  inferences are very basic, some are more involved. The more complex examples
  give ample illustration of the fact that temporal phenomena are usually
  discourse phenomena.
